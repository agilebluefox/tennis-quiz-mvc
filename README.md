# Tennis Quiz (MVC)

Interactive quiz application which tests the users knowledge of some tennis facts about some of the top players on the ATP Tour.

## Technical Skills

CSS, Gulp, HTML, JQuery, Less, Webpack

## Breakdown

This project presented a fun and interesting challenge to design a simple application using the principles of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. The interactive features are entirely dependent on the JQuery library and the code is primarily organized in three distinct files: controller.js, model.js, and view.js. Easy, right? Although the concept seems simple, this application created some unexpected challenges that forced me to focus intently on maintaining the separation of the components into isolated blocks. On several occassions, I found myself unwittingly inserting code which belonged in one division, such as the model, into functions residing in one of the other areas, such as the controller. Overall, this project gave me a greater appreciation of the importance of design patterns and the planning, discipline and commitment it takes to stay on course, especially when a quick shortcut might resolve a mind-bending issue in the short run.

## Notable Accomplishments

The general build system was orchestrated using Gulp JS and a custom gulpfile. Less, the CSS preprocessor, was used to aid in writing more efficient css code. Webpack provided the final bundling of the javascript files that were used in the "production" version of the application. I'm very excited about continuing using these tools, or others like them, as I start new projects in the future.
